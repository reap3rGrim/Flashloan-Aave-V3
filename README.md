# **Implementing a simple flash loan**

**_Code has been tested only on Remix_**

## **Using Remix:**

<br/>

For implementing a simple flash loan, Flashloan.sol in remix should be enough. There are hardhat modules here, as in the future this is planned to be implemented through hardhat.

Modify the execute operation in the Flashloan.sol accordingly
